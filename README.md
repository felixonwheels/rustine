# regenerate directus typescript types

`pnpx directus-typescript-gen --host http://localhost:8055 --email admin@example.com --password d1r3ctu5 --outFile src/lib/types/api-collection.d.ts`

_note to self_: js/ts tooling and dx is so awful i want to die. can't wait to use something like deno or bun that streamlines everything dependency managment, linting, formatting and bundling, that actuallt works with modern framework (like sveltekit for my specific case) ðŸ¥¹
